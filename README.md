# CTIP (Configuration Testing In Parallel)

## Description
CTIP (pronounced 'see-tip') is a convenient way to generate, store, and
run program configurations. It uses SQLite3 to store tables of program
configurations that are run in parallel, either as a whole or selectively,
based on an SQL 'where' clause passed through command line arguments.

## Program requirements
