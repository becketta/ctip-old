BUGS:
    -> Add job ids as they become available instead of
        at the end to avoid HPCC slowdown issues

    CTIP CONFIGURATION:
    => Add HPCC flag
    => Add ctip file structure flag

    GEN/CFG FILES:
    *-> Ability to directly run a gen file
    -> Add range specification to gen files:
            <key>|<min>-<max>:<step>,...
    -> Add nested params to gen files
    -> More thorough treatment of comments in both csv and gen files

    CONFIG RUNNING:
    -> Local runs (break runConfig into initJob and runJob)
    -> Gracefull fail for hitting memory limit in HCPP
            o Look into using smem?
    -> qsub checkpointing
    -> Resubmit jobs that fail due to I/O error in HPCC
